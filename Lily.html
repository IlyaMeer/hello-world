  <p>As you may not know, this is a Mars Rover. If so, it would be totally okay, because all would be explained. This Mars Rover was made to be able to go to Mars and explore Mars. As you may or may not understand the reason behind building this rover, we
    are going to tell you why. Now I would read an excerpt from Why We Built A Rover. To read the whole story, Please visit our website: ilyameer.github.io//helloworld. Enjoy the story. "It was very peaceful that afternoon in Gqegrew Land. Eelya snoozed
    in his living room, just like the way he slept through the weather forecast on the day the tsunami happened. His TV was on again, announcing the votes. It was election day. The big day. The day all the Americans were waiting for. The day everybody
    else was dreading. It was as if Eelya can sense the peacefulness before any kind of storm, and also, sleep that through. His students were watching the map of the United States closely as it was taken over by the bright red... The following Monday,
    Ariel was absent. And she wasn't here on Tuesdar or Wednesday. 'Maybe she's sick.' suggested Sophia. Eelya asked the Gqegrew Land council. Ariel moved to a faraway country called Korea. It's not safe there either, since it would just be a matter of
    time before Trump gets every faraway country, no matter how far. Ariel left just in time before Trump bought all the airplanes so people could no longer escape from where they live.'The only way we're going to survive is to leave Earth. Before Trump
    realizes people may use rockets to escape to other planets, we can make a rover, get it to Mars, and see if we can survive on Mars. Then we'll get ready and go to Mars...'"</p>

  <h2>April 6/2017</h2>
  <p>I went to NanJing during spring break.That is where I came from. I bought so many things that you can't find even if you search the entire Canada. Or at least you won't find it as cheap. Most of what I bought are sweet, unhealthy food. There are so
    many variations and flavours of the most boring kinds you find in Save On Foods. There was one kind I go crazy for, which is this bicuit stick called pejoy. It is close to pocky, but the cream is inside the biscuit. I bought all the available flavours(9
    flavours in all!) and a few other things including buy 1 get 1 cookies that are close to the expire date. Also I went eating sweet and unhealthy things. I ate matcha(green tea) at one of the two best matcha shops in NanJing, and I will eat the other
    best this summer. I also ate fried yogurt, which I prefer over frozen yogurt(I only ate frozen yogurt twice and both times I got sick, so my mom thinks I'm allergic to frozen yogurt). Anyway, I also bought tons of other things, like perfume with your
    zodiac sign and buy 1 get 1 hand sanitizer. But those are the highlights because I personally love eating.</p>
