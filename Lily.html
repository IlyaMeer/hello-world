  <h2>April 6/2017</h2>
  <p>I went to NanJing during spring break.That is where I came from. I bought so many things that you can't find even if you search the entire Canada. Or at least you won't find it as cheap. Most of what I bought are sweet, unhealthy food. There are so many
    variations and flavours of the most boring kinds you find in Save On Foods. There was one kind I go crazy for, which is this bicuit stick called pejoy. It is close to pocky, but the cream is inside the biscuit. I bought all the available flavours(9
    flavours in all!) and a few other things including buy 1 get 1 cookies that are close to the expire date.Also I went eating sweet and unhealthy things. I ate matcha(green tea) at one of the two best matcha shops in NanJing, and I will eat the
    other best this summer. I also ate fried yogurt, which I prefer over frozen yogurt(I only ate frozen yogurt twice and both times I got sick, so my mom thinks I'm allergic to frozen yogurt). Anyway, I also bought tons of other things, like perfume
    with your zodiac sign and buy 1 get 1 hand sanitizer. But those are the highlights because I personally love eating.</p>
