  It was very peaceful that afternoon in Gqegrew Land. Eelya snoozed in his living room, just like the way he slept through the weather forecast on the day the tsunami happened. His TV was on again, announcing the votes. It was election day. The big day. The day all the Americans were waiting for. The day everybody else was dreading.

     It was as if Eelya can sense the peacefulness before any kind of storm, and also, sleep that through.

     Sophia watched closely as the map of the United States got taken over by the bright red. There was something uncomfortable about that  red. The blue surrounded by it seemed soothing and calm, but that’s just not the way the red seemed to her eyes.

     Ariel’s parents watched closely as well, and they were worried. Gqegrew Land was just not a safe place to be if Trump took over. Ariel prayed that Trump will just not win, somehow. She loved Gqegrew Land more than anywhere else.

     Jeffery was looking at Donald Trump memes. They were so good, because the editors of the photos would never in a thousand centuries believe that Trump would someday become president Trump, and either would Jeffery.

     Lily saw wierd videos on wechat. Of Donald-Trumps-on-a-toothpick-on-a-cucumber scaring away screeching cats. Crazily screeching cats. She wished, hoped, dreamed, and prayed that the rest of the map would fill up by the relaxing blue that would make the night come.

     Trump started to buy the States, state after state. 

     Eelya didn’t see the news. He was sure that Trump wouldn’t win. The next day at school, Jeffery bolted into the squishy classroom. “HE IS STARING TO BUY CALIFORNIA WHEN I LEFT HOME FOR SCHOOL!!!! HE PROBABLY ALREADY BOUGHT THAT AND STARTED TO BUY OREGON! THEN HE’S GONNA REACH MY HOME!!!!!!!!!” 

     Then, Sophia flew in. “DONALD TRUMP TOOK MY BINDER!!!” 

     Lily arrived right at 8:40, holding a Donald-Trump-on-a-toothpick-on-a-cucumber. “Try it on your Ilya Cat.”

     Ariel dragged her backpack into the classroom, while Eelya was still processing what his students said. “......so…… Trump? Won ?” “Yea------ah.” His students spoke with one voice.

     The whole week, Eelya thought about this problem.
     The following Monday, Ariel was absent. On Tuesday, both her and Sophia were absent. On Wednesday, Sophia came. Her family moved to a hopefully safer place. On Thursday, Ariel still didn’t come. “Maybe she’s sick.” Suggested Sophia.

     Eelya asked the Gqegrew Land council. Ariel moved to a faraway country called Korea. It’s not safe there either, since Trump has only Alaska and Hawaii left to buy in the U.S. It would just be a matter of time before he gets to every faraway country, no matter how far. Ariel left just in time before Trump bought all the airplanes so that people can no longer escape from where they live.

     “The only way we’re going to survive is to leave Earth. We have some time before Trump…”

     “Close the door!” Lily whisper-shouted. “You never know who is a traitor of Gqegrew Land.” 

     “Okay, we can waste no more time. Before Trump realizes people may use rockets to escape to other planets, we can make a rover, get it to Mars, and see if we can survive on Mars. Then we’ll get ready and go to Mars.

     “Okay, there’s no time to waste. Let’s get some work done.”
